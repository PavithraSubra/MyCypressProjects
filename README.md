# MyCypressProjects
This was my attempt to explore the Cypress Tool.
Please note the project folder consists of sample test scripts as part of learning journey.

The file sample_e2e.cy.js is developed with a vision to test the web application to support cross browser and responsive testing. 
Although the tests does not involve real mobile devices, but the view port option in Cypress makes it possible to test the feature of responsiveness.
This will help  to identify potential defects and any other vulnerable behaviour of the application on varying the screen size. 
There were two defects/unexpected behaviour noticed with the sample website used for testing.
